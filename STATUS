PGE contains three regex engines: a Perl 6 one, a Perl 5 one, and one for
file globbing. The current focus on GGE is to port the Perl 6 regex engine
enough to be able to parse arbitrary Perl 6 grammars (to the extent that
PGE can).

The implementation work proceeds in order of the PGE test files. The
rx_quantifiers was the first one to be attacked, because quantifiers seemed
like great fun. A few tests have been marked TODO in that file, pending
re-entrant regex parsing which stops on a specified precedence level.

The OPTable tests were next. Only one test was marked TODO in there; it
depends on the :parsed argument accepting a GGE::Perl6Regex object as its
value. (No real obstacle to that one; just haven't found it necessary.)

All tests pass in rx_metachars. A few tests are marked TODO in rx_charclass,
having to do with double-quoted literals. The test marked TODO in rx_backtrack
is marked TODO in PGE as well, and pmichaud has confirmed it's likely bogus.
Some tests had to be marked TODO in rx_modifiers, because they used lookahead,
which isn't implemented yet. Some TODOs in rx_captures were inherited from
PGE, others await the implementation of subrules.

There are two features I can see that need to be implemented for the rest
of the tests to pass. The first is some kind of stacking of TreeSpider
objects. This is needed for subrule calls, which form a sort of 'regex in a
regex', both statically and dynamically.  The second is a mechanism for
building real Match objects, replete with numbered and named captures.

Here's a copy of PGE's STATUS, adapted for GGE:

Perl 6 rule features implemented
--------------------------------
* standard regular expression constructs
* quantifiers (*, +, ?, *?, +?, ??, **{m..n}?)
* alternation  (|)
* conjunction  (&)
* non-capturing groups
* enumerated character lists (<[abcdef]>, <-[a..f]>)
* character classes (., \d, \w, \s, \n, \e, \f, \r, \t, \x[hhh], \o[nnn])
* anchors (^, $, ^^, $$, \b, \b)
* \c[...] and \C[...]
* cut operators (:, ::, :::, <commit>)


Perl 6 rule features to-do
--------------------------
* capturing groups
* modifiers :i, :ignorecase, :s, :sigspace (with synonyms :w and :words)
* composed character classes (<+alpha-[aeiou]>)
* negated character classes 
* capturing subrules (<expr>)
* non-capturing subrules  (<.expr>)
* negated subrules (<!expr>)
* lookahead and lookbehind (<before> and <after>)
* built-in rules: <null>, <fail>, <alpha>, <digit>, <alnum>, 
    <upper>, <lower>, <xdigit>, <space>, <print>, <graph>,
    <blank>, <cntrl>, <punct>, <sp>, <lt>, <gt>, <dot>, <ws>,
    <p6rule>, <p5regexp>
* backreferences ($0, $1, $<foo>)
* scalar subrule and subpattern aliases ($<foo>:=(...), $0:=(...))
* balanced delimited text (<GGE::Text::bracketed>)
* embedded closures ({{ puts "hello" }})
* :lang() modifier
* firstchar/nextchar optimizations
* lookbehind according to S05 definition 
* <cut> assertion
* versions of <commit> and cuts that release backtracking state
* :perl5 modifier
* literal assertions (<'literal'>)
* interpolated assertions (<"literal">)
* array and hash aliasing (@<foo>:=(...), %<foo>:=(...))
* don't generate unneeded internal data structures (e.g., gpad)
